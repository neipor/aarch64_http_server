  - Nginx-compatible configuration syntax
  - Support for `http {}`, `server {}`, `location {}` blocks
  - Virtual host support with `server_name` directive
  - SSL certificate path configuration
- **Robust Request Routing**
  - Host-based virtual host matching
  - Location-based request routing
  - Fallback to default server blocks
- **"Green" Application Design**
  - Command-line configuration file specification (`-c` flag)
  - Relative path resolution for portable deployment
  - No hardcoded paths or dependencies
- **Production-Ready Architecture**
  - Multi-process master/worker model
  - Epoll-based event handling for high concurrency
  - Proper resource cleanup and memory management
  - Signal handling for graceful shutdown
- **Comprehensive Testing**
  - Automated Docker-based testing
  - HTTP and HTTPS endpoint validation
  - Timeout protection for hanging tests
  - Container IP-based testing (no port mapping required)
- **Developer Experience**

## Development Notes

### Version 0.2.0 Development Process
This release involved extensive debugging and problem-solving:

1. **SSL Implementation Challenge**: Discovered that SSL connections were timing out due to missing `SSL_accept()` call for handshake completion.

2. **Configuration Architecture**: Completely redesigned configuration system to eliminate global variables and improve modularity.

3. **Docker Development**: Established robust Docker-based development and testing workflow.

4. **Path Resolution**: Implemented sophisticated relative path handling for truly portable deployments.

5. **Testing Infrastructure**: Built comprehensive automated testing with timeout protection and detailed logging.
