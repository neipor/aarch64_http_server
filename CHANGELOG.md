## Development Notes

### Version 0.2.0 Development Process
This release involved extensive debugging and problem-solving:

1. **SSL Implementation Challenge**: Discovered that SSL connections were timing out due to missing `SSL_accept()` call for handshake completion.

2. **Configuration Architecture**: Completely redesigned configuration system to eliminate global variables and improve modularity.

3. **Docker Development**: Established robust Docker-based development and testing workflow.

4. **Path Resolution**: Implemented sophisticated relative path handling for truly portable deployments.

5. **Testing Infrastructure**: Built comprehensive automated testing with timeout protection and detailed logging.

### Contributors
- Primary development and architecture
- Extensive debugging and problem-solving
- Documentation and project planning

### Acknowledgments
- OpenSSL library for SSL/TLS support
- Linux epoll for high-performance I/O
- Docker for containerization support
- Nginx for configuration syntax inspiration
